# Custom convert XML text to Javascript object or JSON text

## Features
* **Customize your XML to JS convertion**:
Most converter libraries will give you some convertion configuration options, but all will end up converting an XML text into a pretty ugly JS or JSON object (been there?? ... I have :( and it sucks!).
This library gives you several options to customize the convertion, such as: mapping property key names, setting which properties are supposed to be arrays or object and formatting the property key names to camel case or to snake case.
This way, you'll end up having a better, prettier and more consistent Javascript object after the XML convertion.

* **Minimal Dependencies**:
This library depends only on one external npm module (xmlbuilder2)

* **Typescript compatible**:
This library is developed using Typescript and the package has built-in type declarations included, so you can use it in your Typescript project and take advantage of the typing for this library.
